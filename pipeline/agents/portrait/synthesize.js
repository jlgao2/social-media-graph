Produce the portrait markdown. Begin with this frontmatter exactly:

${frontmatter}

Then render these sections in order:

# ${name}
*<one-sentence essence — felt, not labelling>*

## Texture
<400-600 words on the music of being in this relationship — how they talk, what they care about, the temperature. Not how they function in your life — the quality.>

## Anchor moments
<5-10 dated quoted exchanges in chronological order. Each formatted as:

**YYYY-MM-DD**
> Them: <exact verbatim from allowlist>
> You: <exact verbatim from allowlist>
<one-line context if needed>

You may use only quotes from the allowlist. Pick the most resonant 5-10 from the list.>

## Recurring threads
<3-5 motifs (not patterns). E.g. "you've been talking about X since YEAR.">

## What care looks like with them
<200-300 words on the grammar of how care actually shows up between you two, specifically.>

## A line for them
<One sentence drawn from the portrait — recognizable, not invented.>`;
